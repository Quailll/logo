# Logo
Generate a logo through javascript and have it show up with the choices you made.
## Description

- To generate a logo using javascript using inquirer and checking your work by testing it. 
- To [create logo](./images/logo.png) and afterwards your saved [choices](./images/logosaves.png) and then your [image](./images/actuallogo.png) logo will show up.
- I was able to understand how to test my own code through javascript with [jest](./images/testcode.png).
- When I was working on this challenge and checking my work the main and mine look very similar, but I used everything that our instructor gave us and did it the way he showed.
